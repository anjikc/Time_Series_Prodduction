# Time Series Modelling and Demand Forecasting using Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) Model and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Model

## Goal

The idea of the project was to compare the forecasting accuracy of a SARIMA model and a Multi-Layer Perceptron Model.

# Data Set

Sample Superset data was used and the analyis was done for furnitutre sales spanning over 2014 to 2017(https://community.tableau.com/docs/DOC-1236)

# Inference

It was found that if the parameters of the MLP were properly chosen then it could provide a better forecasting accuracy compared to the traditional SARIMA model.To compare the forecasting accuracy Root mean square error value for the two models were calculated and compared. Even though the median RMSE value for the MLP value was higher compared to the SARIMA model. The lowest possible value was lesser compared to the SARIMA model. This proves the fact that Neural networks can prove to be a good tool for accurate forecasting provided the parameters are well tuned.
